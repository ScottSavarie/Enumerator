## Installation

1. Download plugin and double click to install


## Usage
1. (ctrl + alt + cmd + e) When you have a bunch of artboards, layers, or whatever and you want to give them all a common name + incrementing number (ex: artboard 01, artboard 02, artboard 03, etc.), use this plugin. It'll look at the objectâ€™s x, y position and then number them accordingly from top to bottom, left to right.
